Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.
Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.

Still wondering about the question tho

class Solution:
    def hIndex(self, citations: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(citations)
        citations.sort()

        for i,v in enumerate(citations):
            if n - i <= v:
                return n - i
        return 0

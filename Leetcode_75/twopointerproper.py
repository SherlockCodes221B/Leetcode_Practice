Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], k = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: Starting with nums = [1,2,3,4]:
- Remove numbers 1 and 4, then nums = [2,3]
- Remove numbers 2 and 3, then nums = []
There are no more pairs that sum up to 5, hence a total of 2 operations.

nums = [4,4,1,3,1,3,2,2,5,5,1,5,2,1,2,3,5,4]
k = 2
o/p: 2
